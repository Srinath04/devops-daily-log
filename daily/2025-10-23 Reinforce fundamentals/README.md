Parallel to the CKA study, I was working on **Old HP laptop repair planning**:

Tried to make the freezed laptop function for basics and recommended below upgrades
    
- Objective: improve performance and reduce high disk usage (100%) issues observed earlier.

- **Mandatory repairs:** SSD replacement and fan servicing.
    
- **Optional upgrades:** Converting HDD to external hard disk.
    
- Also sticked a **clear written note** for the service center mentioning essential checks and instructions.
