Its unfortunate to encounter the same exam environment specific cluster issue which i have faced last time too.
 
Faced some errors with the PSI secure browser verification before and post exam, although my host systems met all required specofications. 

Again raised a ticket to Linux Foundation on this.

Confident that even without counting the questions affected by exam-cluster issues, my performance on all other tasks would place me well above the passing threshold.
