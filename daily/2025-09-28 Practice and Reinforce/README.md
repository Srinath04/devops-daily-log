**Update (28 Sept 2025):**

- Gave 3 mock exams, scoring around 70% on average; need to improve speed for reviewing flagged questions
    
- Clarified if manual edits are valid in the CKA exam or Kustomize patches are preferred for grading.
    
- Reviewed TLS certificates in Kubernetes â€” how they are stored in Secrets and referenced in Gateway configs.
    
- Explored port mirroring (`requestMirror`) behavior and understood how backendRefs on the same port (80) work internally without conflict.
