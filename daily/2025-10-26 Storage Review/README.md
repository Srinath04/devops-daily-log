###  Kubernetes Storage Deep Dive

Today‚Äôs progress covered **Persistent Volume (PV)**, **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**, and **StorageClass (SC)** in detail:

- **PV:** Learned how it represents actual physical storage in the cluster, managed by the admin.
    
- **PVC:** Understood how users request storage by specifying size and access modes, which then bind to an available PV.
    
- **StorageClass:** Explored how it automates storage provisioning using provisioners, allowing dynamic allocation instead of manual PV creation.
    
- Also reviewed how **PVs and PVCs decouple storage from pods**, making storage persistent across pod restarts, and how **reclaim policies** (Retain, Delete) handle released storage resources.
