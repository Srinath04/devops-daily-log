Today's learning was about **Persistent Volumes (PV)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)** â€” understanding how PVs provide storage resources in a cluster and how PVCs act as user requests to claim that storage.  Explored how they enable **decoupling of storage from pods**, ensuring data persists even if pods are deleted or rescheduled.

learned about **storage classes and volume drivers**, which define how storage is **provisioned dynamically** and how different **backend storage systems (like AWS EBS, NFS, or CSI drivers)** integrate with Kubernetes to manage volumes efficiently.
