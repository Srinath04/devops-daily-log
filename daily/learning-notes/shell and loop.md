- Explored shell navigation and how pager function in tools like more with terminal screen propotions
    
- Understood why loops like `for i in * .*` encounter `.` and `..`
    
- Learned **why the `if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ]` check is needed** and what could go wrong without it
    
- Handling **cron mishaps**, how root can be fully removed
    
- Started reviewing **privileged vs non-privileged demo setups** to strengthen environment awareness
    
-  **validating loop behavior** with net tools like `nc`  

Overall : **foundational shell understanding getting sharper** around _why things behave the way they do_. Solid progress
