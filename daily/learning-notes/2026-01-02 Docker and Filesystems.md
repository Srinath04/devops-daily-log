### OverlayFS

- Strengthened Linux fundamentals, especially around user context and execution behavior.

- Understood OverlayFS as a union filesystem that merges multiple directories into a single view.

- Learned the purpose of OverlayFS components

- Observed how file creation, modification, and deletion behave

- Practiced manual mounting of OverlayFS and validated behavior using `ls`, `tree`, and `touch`.

- Learned why workdir must be empty and owned correctly for OverlayFS to function.

- Gained clarity on why containers are lightweight and how filesystem isolation works without full VMs.
