### Passwordless SSH (ed25519)

- Set up passwordless SSH login between my own machines using ed25519 keys.

- Understood why ed25519 is preferred over RSA (smaller keys, stronger security, faster auth).

- Practiced key generation, copying public keys, and validating non-interactive SSH access.

- Reinforced secure access habits for day-to-day ops and automation workflows.

### Git Blame — What & How (without “people blame”)

- Learned what git blame actually does: shows when and why a line changed, not who to accuse.

Can be used to:

- Trace context behind code changes

- Identify intent or assumptions in older commits

- Speed up debugging by understanding history

- Frame git blame as a learning & investigation tool, not a fault-finding mechanism.

- Focus on code evolution and decisions, aligning with healthy team culture.
