### Shell scripting

- Explored **`awk`** for field extraction and line- evel processing (patterns, columns, and filtering).
    
- Practiced **shell navigation** deeply - moving using relative/absolute paths.
    
- Understood **starter shell behavior**: how commands are interpreted before execution.
    
- Learned **shell globbing** (`*`, `?`) and how the shell expands patterns _before_ commands run.
    
- Strengthened command line thinking by chaining tools instead of relying on single commands.
