### Learning Progress continues with

- Advanced understanding of Dockerfile execution flow

- Clearified distinction between RUN (build-time) vs CMD / ENTRYPOINT (runtime)

- Learned exec form vs shell form and why exec is preferred in production

- Understood PID 1 responsibility, signal handling, and container lifecycle

- Explored how CMD and ENTRYPOINT interact, override behavior, and real-world use cases

### Key takeaway:

- Containers behave predictably only when CMD/ENTRYPOINT are designed with process ownership and signal handling.
