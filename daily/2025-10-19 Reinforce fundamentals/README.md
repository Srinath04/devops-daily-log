### **Git Note â€“ `git reset --soft`**

`git reset --soft <commit>` moves the **HEAD pointer** to a specified commit **without touching my working directory or staging area**.

ðŸ”¹ **Effect:**

- Keeps changes **staged** (in index).
- Only updates the commit history (HEAD).
- Useful for **undoing commits** while preserving staged work.

ðŸ§­ **Example:**

`git reset --soft HEAD~1`

This undoes the **last commit** but keeps all changes staged â€” so that i can recommit with a new message or additional edits.

ðŸª¶ **Tip:**  
Used `--soft` As realizing the commit message was okay but accidentally removed previous file.
