Today’s learning focused on Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) — a powerful way to extend Kubernetes with custom resource types that behave like native objects. Explored how CRDs enable defining custom APIs to represent application specific configurations or workflows, beyond built-in resources like Pods and Services. Also understood the structure of a CRD manifest, how it registers a new resource with the Kubernetes API, and how it can be paired with custom controllers or operators to automate domain-specific logic and lifecycle management.
