## Daily Learning — Learning from Real System Failures

Studied real-world failure analysis through SRE and systems engineering talks.

Key learnings:
- Complex systems fail due to aligned reasonable decisions, not single mistakes.
- Root cause analysis alone is insufficient for preventing future incidents.
- Blameless postmortems enable learning by focusing on system behavior under pressure.
- Preventing failure requires designing for reversibility and reduced blast radius.

This reinforced my shift from a reactive fixing mindset to understanding systemic failure patterns.
